## Hey Everone, I am Jay!

Welcome to my blog! Thanks for giving your precious time to this blog of mine. I hope it turns out to be useful to you.

I am an undergrad student at IIITV, currently in my sophomore year. I love coding, eating, travelling, writing and reading differant literatures, and travelling. I am the Joint Secretary of Coding Club, IIITV currently. I began coding a bit early in my life, you can read more about my journey with coding [here](/learn/coding/2018/09/02/journey-before-iiitv.html){:target="_blank"}. I like developing websites, but I am also interested in the fields of Machine Learning and AI. I plan on diving deep into those fields later on. To get more updates about this blog, or know more about my life, you can follow me on my social media accounts. I'll be posting updates about my blog there, until I get a mailing list support ready.
