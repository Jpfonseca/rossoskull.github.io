    <description>Hey everyone! I am Jay Mistry, a sophomore at IIIT Vadodara. I got into coding a bit early in
 my life, and am loving it since then! I love learning new stuff, and building things that help 
 out me, and others. I believe in building a solution, rather than finding it someplace else. You 
 can know more about me on one of my social handles. Thanks for visiting!

        <title>My Journey After Joining IIITV</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The environment around me ( before joining IIITV ) was that I was the one who knew most of the stuff, and eventually it made me a bit lazy. It happens that when you feel that you know ‘enough’, you stop pushing yourself, and learning new things. It happened with me too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after joining IIITV, I was introduced to a differant environment, a community of students, who knew a hell lot more than me, and also, they were inspiring and helping. There were some seniors who inspired me to move forward and push myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I was introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sport Programming&lt;/a&gt;. Sport Programming helped me understand the importance of Logic. Also I came to know, whatever solution we may find to a problem, there may be some optimal solutions which may change the game. For example, if we create an application for sorting &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; numbers, we have a number of algorithms to choose from. Let’s say Person &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; creates a code to sort &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; numbers using Bubble Sort algorithm, and Person &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; uses Heap Sort algorithm, then the program by Person &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; will be able to solve more lists of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; numbers, as Heap Sort is a better algorithm than Bubble Sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got an introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt; ( Free and Open Source Softwares ) too. The community in our institute is a bit inclined towards FOSS. FOSS has a really huge community base all over the world. Even before joining IIITV, I had used many FOSS softwares, like Inkscape ( alternative to Adobe Illustrator ), GIMP ( alternative to Adobe Photoshop ), LibreOffice ( alternative to Microsoft Office ),etc. The main reason behind using FOSS was the price factor. They are free to use, and also offer very similar features. Also they have very huge and active communities. And the best part is that you can contribute directly into the software that you use. The students at IIITV, who actively contribute to FOSS, also manage to get selected into &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Summer Of Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other newly thriving fields, like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, etc. also caught my attention here. But currently I am more focused towards Web Development and contributing to FOSS. There is a great deal to learn from the communities that support FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, and soon it became one of my favourite languages. You can do almost anything with Python - web development, ML, AI, CV, scripting, etc. I also got my hands on Django - a Python framework that makes the lives of web developers a lot easy. It had a lot of inbuilt functionalities that help in shipping a product really fast. Also, from a security point of view, Django has a lot of tools and inbuilt functionalities to help you. It is a very powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first Summer break, I tried running &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; on the backend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;. It was great to know that we can do backend and frontend development using a single language ( most parts ). Also JavaScript has a huge community too, so we have access to lot of libraries and frameworks, like ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS, EmberJS, etc. I also learnt VueJS, as it is trending now-a-days. VueJS incorporates the best parts of ReactJS and AngularJS in a single framework. Also JavaScript has entered the buzzing tech worlds of AI, ML, CV, etc. It’s interesting where JavaScript will go in the future. As it is commonly said, &lt;i&gt;“Anything that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript”&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I am learning ReactJS, a Frontend framework in JavaScript. There are certain FOSS projects which I intend to contribute to, and the frontend part is developed using ReactJS, so learning it will help me in contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll wrap up this post here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adios Folks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Journey Before Joining IIITV</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! Today I’ll discuss my journey - how it all started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began my coding journey a bit early in my life, and since then, it’s been wonderful. I try to keep learning new things everyday. I also believe in application. As it is known, only knowledge, and no application leads that knowledge to waste. So, Keep Learning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my journey in coding with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;QBASIC&lt;/a&gt;. As it’s name suggests, it’s for beginners. So I didn’t have a hard time with it. And with spending more time with it, I realised that I started to love Coding. The thought that I could possibly create &lt;b&gt;anything&lt;/b&gt; fascinated me. I felt “God-like”, we can say. And so it began - my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I started building simple web pages using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;. I remember them being really ugly, but I learnt a lot from it. I started understanding the structure of the pages I was visiting frequently - facebook, google, wikipedia, etc. Though the code was tough to read, I managed to understand it a bit. And eventually, my understanding of web pages and sites started to become good ( I wasn’t familiar with any backend stuff back then, so I didn’t know what happened behind the scenes on those sites ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;C&lt;/a&gt; - the language that introduced me to Errors and Debugging. There were errors in QBASIC, but the code I used to write back then was so minimal and small, there wasn’t a huge scope for good errors. But with C, everything changed. There were segmentation faults, type errors, logical errors and what not. This helped me learn how the computer worked behind the scenes. As C is a language that is closer to the system, I would recommend first-timers to start with a language like C, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I learnt &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt; from the book ‘C++ For Dummies, 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Edition’. Then I learnt the concepts of object oriented programming. I remember how happy I was, when my code of a banking system finally worked, wherein you would be able to create accounts, login, credit and debit money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I learnt &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; in my 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; class. It was taught as a part of our curriculum, but I learnt more than that. What the teachers taught was very simple, basically it was what I learnt with C, the only differance now was that of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway through my 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; class, entered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;. PHP intrigued me a lot as it helped me out of the dead-looking Console window, and into the browsers. I started off simply - fetching data from databases and displaying, and inserting data into the databases using forms. Then I created a user management system, which handled the login, registration and sessions of users. My final project using PHP was called “Veroyo” ( modified from “True me” in italian ), which was a social networking site, where it had a user management system and a posts management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got enrolled into IIITV, and my way of learning stuff changed. But more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adios folks.&lt;/p&gt;
